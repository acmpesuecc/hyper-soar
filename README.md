# HyperSoar - Defy your Limits


Welcome to HyperSoar, a front-end website built using React and Tailwind CSS. HyperSoar offers a visually stunning and user-friendly experience for to purchase drones and anyone passionate about drones. Whether you're an amateur drone pilot or a seasoned expert, HyperSoar has something special for you. 
This is a pure front-end site, designed to implement a UI designed by me.

## JWT

What is a JWT Token?

A JWT (JSON Web Token) is like a digital passport for the internet. It's a small piece of information that can be sent securely from one place to another.

How Does it Work?

Imagine you log into a website. After you log in, the server creates a JWT token that contains information about you.
This token is like a keycard. It's unique to you and has some details, such as your name, role, and an expiration date.

Stateless Nature:

JWT tokens can be "stateless." This means once the server gives you the token, it doesnâ€™t need to remember anything about you.
Every time you make a request to the server (like asking for a webpage), you show your token. The server reads the token and knows who you are without needing to remember past interactions.
However the server cannot revoke the session any time (must wait for client) and security decreases.

Stateful Nature:

JWT tokens can be "stateful." The server will remember your credentials and store it in its database. This increases the security of the system, users can be tracked, password retrieval is easier and session expiry in case the user forgets to log out becomes easy.
This is why stateful authentication has been implemented here.
The server remembers the user's email and password and stores it in its database.
